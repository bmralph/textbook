# Apply functions

Functions are named recipes.  We often find that we want to apply
such a recipe to each value in a Pandas Series.

This is the job of the `apply` method of a Series.

To start, we load the familiar [Ratings
data](../data/rate_my_professors), giving the average ratings on
various measures for all rated professors teaching a subject,
such as English, mathematics, and so on.

```{python}
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Safe setting for using Pandas.
pd.set_option('mode.copy_on_write', True)
```

```{python}
ratings = pd.read_csv('rate_my_course.csv')
ratings.head()
```

There are 75 rows in this dataset, one row for each of 75
subjects:

```{python}
n = len(ratings)
n
```

Now let us say that we are interested in the `Easiness` ratings:

```{python}
easiness = ratings['Easiness']
easiness
```

We decide we want to classify each subject into one of three groups:

* "Easy" for courses that have `Easiness` scores above the 75%
  percentile for `Easiness`.
* "Hard" for courses below the 25% percentile.
* "Medium" for courses between the 25% and 75% percentile.

You might first wonder how to get the percentiles.   One way to
do it, is to use the `percentile` function from Numpy.  For
example, the median is the value at the 50% percentile, meaning
that half the values are below the median and half are above
(well, it's a little more complicated than that, but that's right
to a first pass).

Here's the median:

```{python}
np.median(easiness)
```

This is, by definition, the 50% percentile:

```{python}
np.percentile(easiness, 50)
```

Here are the 25% and 75% percentiles:

```{python}
easy_25 = np.percentile(easiness, 25)
print('25% percentile is', easy_25)
easy_75 = np.percentile(easiness, 75)
print('75% percentile is', easy_75)
```

We can then write a function that we send a value (call the value
`v`), and return the classification, using the `easy_25` and
`easy_75` values.

Notice that the function can see the `easy_25` and `easy_75` values in the top-level workspace:

```{python}
def classify_easy(v):
    if v < easy_25:
        return 'Hard'
    if v > easy_75:
        return 'Easy'
    return 'Medium'
```

We expect this function to return "Hard" for a value of 3 (it's below the 25% percentile):

```{python}
classify_easy(3)
```

It should return "Easy" for a value of 3.4 (it's above the 75% percentile):

```{python}
classify_easy(3.4)
```

An intermediate value should give "Medium":

```{python}
classify_easy(3.2)
```

Now let us imagine we want to apply this function to all the values in the `easiness` series.

We could do this laboriously, by making an array to store the values, like this:

```{python}
classified = np.repeat(['Unknown'], n)
classified[:10]
```

This is an array with 75 values of the string "Unknown".  We are going to replace the "Unknown" values with the classifications from calling `classify_easy` on each of the `easiness` scores in turn, like this:

```{python}
# The long way to apply classify_easy to easiness.
for i in np.arange(n):
    # Get the easiness value at this position.
    value = easiness.iloc[i]
    # Call `classify_easy` on this value, put it into
    # the `classified` array.
    classified[i] = classify_easy(value)
classified[:10]
```

That is the long way to do that task, because Pandas Series have an `apply` method to do just that.  We send the `apply` method the function we want to apply on each value in the Series, and it calls the function on each value, and returns the result, as a new Series:

```{python}
classified_series = easiness.apply(classify_easy)
classified_series
```

To see the results, we might make a new DataFrame to show the
original `Easiness` scores and the classification side-by-side.

```{python}
df = pd.DataFrame()
df['Easiness'] = easiness
df['Easiness group'] = classified_series
df
```

## `apply` and DataFrames

In fact, DataFrames also have an `apply` method, that does a
similar thing to the `apply` method of a Series, but on a
DataFrame.

Remember, the `apply` method of the Series calls the supplied function on each *value* in the Series.

The `apply` function of a DataFrame calls the supplied function
on each *row* or each *column* of the DataFrame.

You can specify whether you want to apply the function to each row, or to each column, with the `axis` keyword argument to the `apply` method.

This is easier to see in practice, than to describe.

For example, let's imagine the slightly odd situation where we
want to do something different if the subject name ends in "ogy"
than if it does not.

If the subject name ends in "ogy", then we want to return a string giving the rounded "Clarity" score, and otherwise, we want to return a string giving the rounded "Easiness" score.

For example, for the row for discipline "Biology" we want to
return the string "Clarity for Biology is 3.61" (the "Clarity"
value for Biology is 3.608331).

But for "English" we want to return the string "Easiness for
English is 3.16" (the "Easiness" score for English is 3.162754).

We could use a function like this:

```{python}
def apply_on_row(row):
    discipline = row['Discipline']
    if discipline[-3:] == 'ogy':  # Subject ends in "ogy".
        col_name = 'Clarity'
    else:
        col_name = 'Easiness'
    # Value rounded to 2 decimal places.
    val = round(row[col_name], 2)
    # Make and return the string.
    return col_name + ' for ' + discipline + ' was ' + str(val)
```

Here is that function applied to the row for "Biology":

```{python}
apply_on_row(ratings.iloc[2])
```

And for the "English" row:

```{python}
apply_on_row(ratings.iloc[0])
```

We can apply this function to every row, returning a Series, by
using the DataFrame `apply` function with `axis=1`.  `axis=1`
means apply the function to each value selected across the second
axis, that is, across the columns.  When we ask for a value
across the columns, we get a row (all the columns in one row):

Notice that this returns a new Series, where each value is the
result of applying the `apply_on_row` function to one row:

```{python}
ratings.apply(apply_on_row, axis=1)
```
