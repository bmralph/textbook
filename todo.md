# Todo


Page on official name, variable name for module import.  Covering:

```{python}
import numpy
import numpy as np
# Why does `from np import cos` fail?
from numpy import cos
```

Add page / section on `Series.value_counts`.

Cover:

* bar charts
* histograms
* scatter plots
* maybe maps.

Explain and `.copy()` for Pandas Series.

Improve discussion of mean as center of distribution.

Move to "what's my best guess" idea for sum of squared deviations.

Need to slow down a bit for the mean / sum of squares discussion.

Remove, de-emphasize or at least comment on t-test calculation, including in
exercise.

Introduction to probability.

Better introduction to functions, and docstrings.

Extend discussion of lists and tuples.

Consider introduction to dictionaries.

Use RMSE throughout.   Maybe a note on relationship of RMSE and SS, maybe
something on the idea of being *monotonic*.

Use student ratings dataset to demonstrate regression, residuals "controlling for".

Break logistic regression page into least-squares, and logit pages.

Least square page moves from straight line prediction, to straight line
clipped at 0 and 1.  Show that adding values at left and right causes changes
in unclipped portion of line.
