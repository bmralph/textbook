# Todo


Page on official name, variable name for module import.  Covering:

```{python}
import numpy
import numpy as np
# Why does `from np import cos` fail?
from numpy import cos
```

Hide much of `population_permutation`, to avoid boring data frame logic.

Cover:

* bar charts
* histograms
* scatter plots
* maybe maps.

Explain and do `.copy()` for Pandas series throughout.

Improve discussion of mean as center of distribution.

Move to "what's my best guess" idea for sum of squared deviations.

Need to slow down a bit for the mean / sum of squares discussion.

Remove, de-emphasize or at least comment on t-test calculation, including in
exercise.

Introduction to probability.

Better introduction to functions, and docstrings.

Extend discussion of lists and tuples.

Consider introduction to dictionaries.

Use RMSE throughout.   Maybe a note on relationship of RMSE and SS, maybe
something on the idea of being *monotonic*.
