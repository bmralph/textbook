# Handling Pandas safely

A lot of Pandas' design is for speed and efficiency.

Unfortunately, this sometimes means that is it easy to use Pandas incorrectly,
and so get results that you do not expect.

This page has some rules we suggest you follow to stay out of trouble when using Pandas.

As your understanding increases, you may find that you can relax some of these
rules, but the problems in this page can trip up experts, so please, be very
careful, and only relax these rules when you are very confident you understand
the underlying problems.  See [Gory Pandas](gory_pandas) for a short walk
through some of the complexities.


## Copies and views

Consider this data frame, which should be familiar. It is a table where the
rows are course subjects and the columns include average ratings for all
University professors / lecturers teaching that subject. See [the dataset
page](../data/rate_my_professors) for more detail.

```{python}
import pandas as pd
```

```{python}
ratings = pd.read_csv('rate_my_course.csv')
ratings.head()
```

Now imagine that we have discovered that the rating for 'Clarity' in the first
row is incorrect; it should be 4.0.

We get ready to make a new, fixed copy of the data frame, to store the modified
values.  We put the 'Disciplines' column into the data frame to start with.

```{python}
fixed_ratings = pd.DataFrame()
fixed_ratings['Discipline'] = ratings['Discipline']
```

Our next obvious step is to get the 'Clarity' column as a Pandas Series, for us
to work on.

```{python}
clarity = ratings['Clarity']
clarity.head()
```

We set the corrected first value:

```{python}
clarity.iloc[0] = 4
clarity.head()
```

Notice the warning.  We will come back to that soon.

Notice too that we have changed the value in the `clarity` Series.

Consider --- **what happens to the matching value in the original data frame**?

To answer that question, we need to know what kind of thing our `clarity` Series was.

`clarity` could be a *view* onto the 'Clarity' column in the original data
frame `ratings`.  A view is something that points to the *same memory*.  When
we have a view, the view is another way of looking at the *same data*.  If we
modify the data in the view, that means we also modify the original data frame,
because the *data is the same*.

`clarity` could also be *copy* of the 'Clarity' column. A copy duplicates the
values from the original data.  Therefore a copy has its own values, and its
own memory.  Changing the data in the copy will have no effect on the original
data frame, because the *data is different*.

```{python}
ratings.head()
```

We have found that the `clarity` Series was a *view*, because the change we
made to `clarity` also changed the value in the original data frame.

This may not be what you expected, and it is probably not what you meant to do.

There are two basic strategies for dealing with this problem.

## New Strategy (for Pandas >= 1.5): ask Pandas to copy when necessary

This strategy uses a feature that is new in Pandas version 1.5.

You can't use this strategy for Pandas versions below 1.5.

The summary is — always put this line after you import Pandas, and before you
execute any code using Pandas:

```{python}
# Ask Pandas to make a copy under the hood, when needed.
pd.set_option('mode.copy_on_write', True)
```

That line enables the *copy-on-write* option.  After you apply this option,
Pandas uses an algorithm to work out when to make a copy.  You can think if
this option as being equivalent to making everything a copy.   For example,
consider the problem we had above.

```{python tags=c("raises-exception")}
# The current values of the `ratings` data frame.
ratings.head()
```

```{python}
# A column from the data frame.
clarity = ratings['Clarity']
clarity.head()
```

As before, we set another corrected first value:

```{python}
clarity.iloc[0] = 99
clarity.head()
```

We set `clarity` as we expected.  But this time, with the `mode.copy_on_write`
option, we did not change the `ratings` data frame from which we selected the
`clarity` values.

```{python}
ratings.head()
```

Notice that the first `Clarity` value in `ratings` did not change — it is still
4 and not 99.

The value in `ratings` did not change because you can think of the
`ratings['Clarity']` expression as *always taking a copy not a view*
[^copy-write].

[^copy-write]: In fact Pandas is even cleverer than that.
  `ratings['Clarity']` _is_ a view, but when you do `clarity.iloc[0] = 99`,
  Pandas detects the *write* operation on the view, and then, under the hood,
  does a copy, so the write operation works on the copy, and not on the
  original.  Hence *copy on write*.

If you have Pandas >= 1.5, we strongly suggest you apply this strategy.  And in
fact, you will see that all the notebooks in this course that `import pandas`
also have the magic line:

```{python}
pd.set_option('mode.copy_on_write', True)
```

### "Chained assignment" and copy-on-write

Remember, we have `mode.copy_on_write` enabled here.

Consider the following code.

```{python}
row_0 = ratings.loc[0]  # Effectively, a *copy* of row labeled 0.
row_0.loc['Clarity'] = 199
```

Sure enough, you have set the `row_0` `Clarity` value:

```{python}
row_0
```

At this stage, with `mode.copy_on_write` enabled, you would expect the first
row of `ratings` to stay the same, because Pandas effectively copies the first
row, before doing the assignment into the copy.  And you'd be right to expect
that.

```{python}
ratings.loc[0]
```

But — you may sometimes fail to think of this copy, and be surprised at the
result.  For example, consider the following code:

```{python}
# "Chained assignment".
# Assigning a value to a chain of fetched values.
ratings.loc[0].loc['Clarity'] = 199
ratings.loc[0]
```

Notice that here, `ratings.loc[0]` does not change.

This kind of code is sometimes called *chained assignment* because you are
*chaining* the fetch of the values on the left hand side.  First you are
fetching `ratings.loc[0]` and then, from the result, you fetching the `Clarity`
value.  Then you are *assigning* to this *chain* of fetched values.

Chained assignment can be confusing, because the first line in the cell above
*looks as if* it is setting the `Clarity` value for the row labeled 0.  But in
fact, the code is exactly equivalent to the code cells just above that, and has
the same effect. That is `ratings.loc[0]` effectively results in a copy, so
`ratings.loc[0].loc['Clarity'] = 99` is setting the `Clarity` value to 99 *in
the copy*, which Python will then immediately discard, because you are not
storing the copy anywhere.  So, if you are not careful, you may *think* you are
modifying the underlying `ratings` data frame, but you are not, because of the
internal copying implied by `mode.copy_on_write`.


If you do want to set the `Clarity` value of the row labeled 0, you need to
have a left hand side that does not use the chaining that you see above.  To do
this, specify the row and column in a single left-hand-side expression, like this:

```{python}
# "Unchained assignment".
# Assigning a value directly to a fetched value, no chain.
ratings.loc[0, 'Clarity'] = 199  # No chain on the left-hand side.
ratings.loc[0]
```

## Old Strategy (for Pandas < 1.5): three simple rules


But now we return to the older, darker world of Pandas < 1.5, where you cannot
enable `mode.copy_on_write`.   What should you do then?

To make the rest of the notebook be more like older Pandas, we turn off the
`mode.copy_on_write` feature:

```{python}
# To make Pandas in the rest of this notebook look more like Pandas < 1.5.
pd.set_option('mode.copy_on_write', False)
```

If you can't enable `mode.copy_on_write`, we suggest you follow the following
three simple rules to make sure it less likely you run into trouble.

### Old strategy rule 1: copy right.

We strongly suggest that when you get stuff out of a Pandas data frame or
Series by indexing, you always make what you have into a copy.

We call this rule *copy right*.

As a reminder *indexing* is where we fetch data from something using square
brackets.  Indexing can be: *direct*, with the square brackets directly
following the data frame or Series; or *indirect*, where the square brackets
follow the `.loc` or `.iloc` attributes of the data frame or Series.

For example, we have just used direct indexing (square brackets) to fetch the
'Clarity' data out of the `ratings` data frame.

```{python}
# Indexing to fetch a Series from a data frame.
clarity = ratings['Clarity']
```

We found that `clarity` is a *view* onto the 'Clarity' data in `ratings`.
This is rarely what we want.

Here we apply the *copy right* rule:

```{python}
# Applying the "copy right" rule.
clearer_clarity = ratings['Clarity'].copy()
```

Notice we apply the `.copy()` method to the 'Clarity' Series, so forcing Pandas
to make us a copy of the data.

Now we have done that, we can modify the result without affecting the original
data frame.

```{python}
# Modify the copy with some crazy value.
clearer_clarity.iloc[0] = 99
clearer_clarity.head()
```

This does not affect the original data frame:

```{python}
ratings.head()
```

### A digression: copies, views, confusing, warnings

It can be very difficult to predict when Pandas indexing will give a copy or a
view.

For example, here we use indirect indexing (square brackets following `.loc`)
to select the row of `ratings` with index label 0.  Remember `.loc` indexing
uses the *index labels*, not *positions*, although in this case the index has
label 0 for position 0.

```{python}
row_0 = ratings.loc[0]
row_0
```

We saw earlier that direct indexing to select a column 'Clarity' gave us a
view, meaning that we could change the values in the data frame by changing the
Series `clarity` we got from indexing.  In fact this is also true if we use
indirect indexing with `.loc` or `.iloc`.  Check this by trying `clarity =
ratings.loc[:, 'Clarity']` in the code above.

We have just fetched the row labeled 0 using `.loc`.  Given what we know about
fetching a column, it would be reasonable to predict this would give us a view.

Does it give a view?  Or a copy?

```{python}
# Changing the 'Clarity' value of the first row.
row_0.loc['Clarity'] = 5
row_0
```

Notice the warning, again.

But - this time - did we change the original data frame?

```{python}
ratings.head()
```

No, we didn't change the original data frame --- and we conclude that `row_0`
is a *copy*.

Our first, correct, response is to follow the *copy right* rule, and make this
copy explicit, so we know exactly what we have:

```{python}
# The "copy right" rule again.
copied_row_0 = ratings.iloc[0].copy()
```

We no longer have a nasty warning when we modify `copied_row_0`, because Pandas
knows we made a copy, so it does not need to warn us that we may be making a
mistake:

```{python}
# We don't get a warning when we change the copied result.
copied_row_0.loc['Clarity'] = 5
copied_row_0
```

**Please do worry about these warnings**.  In fact, in the interests of safety,
we come to old strategy rule 2.

### Old strategy rule 2: make errors for copy/view warnings

Pandas has a setting that allows you to change the nasty warning about setting
with copies into an error.

If you can't enable `mode.copy_on_write` as above, we strongly suggest that you
do enable these errors, for all your notebooks, like this:

```{python}
pd.set_option('mode.chained_assignment', 'raise')
```

After you have set this option, Pandas will stop if you try to do something like the following:

```{python tags=c("raises-exception")}
row_0 = ratings.loc[0]   # Copy?  Or view?  Difficult to guess.
# Now this generates an error.
row_0.loc['Clarity'] = 299
```

At first you will find this advice annoying.  Your code will generate confusing
errors, and you will be tempted to remove this error option to make the errors
go away.  Please be patient.  You will find that, if you follow the *copy
right* rule carefully, most of these errors go away.


### Another digression: copy, views, on the left

There is more discussion of this subject in the [Gory Pandas
page](gory_pandas.Rmd).

If you are reading this page from start to finish, you will have already seen
our discussion of chained assignment above.  Here we repeat ourselves a little
for the sake our our less linear readers. Consider this code:

```{python tags=c("raises-exception")}
ratings.loc[0].loc['Clarity'] = 299
```

Because we have set the `mode.chained_assignment` option to `error` above, this
generates an error — but why?

The reason is the same as the reason for the previous error.  The code in the
cell directly above is just a short-cut for this exact equivalent.

```{python tags=c("raises-exception")}
tmp = ratings.loc[0]
tmp.loc['Clarity'] = 299
```

Specifically, when Python sees `ratings.loc[0].loc['Clarity'] = 299`, it first
evaluates `ratings.loc[0]` to generate a temporary copy.  In the code above, we
called this temporary copy `tmp`. It then tries to set the value into the copy
with `tmp.loc['Clarity'] = 299`.  This generates the same error as you saw
before.

As you have probably guessed from the option name above, Pandas calls this
*chained assignment*, because you are: first, fetching the stuff you want do
the assignment on (`ratings.loc[0]`) and then doing the assignment
`.loc['Clarity'] = 299`. There are two steps on the left hand side, in a chain,
first fetching the data, then assigning.

The problem that Pandas has is that it cannot tell that this chained assignment
has happened, so it can't tell what you mean.  Python will ask Pandas to
generate `ratings.loc[0]` first, which it does, to generate the temporary copy
that we can call `tmp`. Python then asks Pandas to set the value with
`tmp.loc['Clarity'] = 299`.  When Pandas gets this second instruction, it has no
way of knowing that `tmp` came from the combined instruction
`ratings.loc[0].loc['Clarity'] = 299`, and so all it can do is set the value
into the copy, as instructed.

This leads us to the last rule.


### Old strategy rule 3: loc left

When you do want to use indexing on the left hand side, to set some values into
a data frame or Series, try do to this all in one shot, using indirect indexing
with `.loc` or `iloc`.

For example, you have just see that this generates an error, and why:

```{python tags=c("raises-exception")}
ratings.loc[0].loc['Clarity'] = 299
```

You can avoid that error by doing all your left-hand-side indexing in one shot,
like this:

```{python}
ratings.loc[0, 'Clarity'] = 299
ratings.loc[0]
```

Notice there is no error.  This is because, in this second case, Pandas gets
all the instructions in one go.  It can see from this combined instruction that
we *meant* to set the 'Clarity' value for the row labeled 0 in the `ratings`
data frame, and does just this.


### Old strategy summary: keep calm, follow the three rules

Do not worry if some of this is not immediately clear; it is not easy.

The trick is to remember the three rules:

* Copy right.
* Make copy warnings into errors.
* Use `.loc` and `.iloc` for your left-hand-side indexing.
