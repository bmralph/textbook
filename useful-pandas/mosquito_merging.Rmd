# Mosquitoes, beer, before, after

This is an example of merging in the familiar [mosquito
beer](https://github.com/matthew-brett/datasets/tree/master/mosquito_beer)
dataset.  Please also look at the [the data license
page](../data/LICENSE).

If you want to run this notebook on your own computer, Download the data from
{download}`mosquito_beer.csv <../data/mosquito_beer.csv>`.

```{python}
# Import Numpy library, rename as "np"
import numpy as np
# Make random number generator.
rng = np.random.default_rng()
# Import Pandas library, rename as "pd"
import pandas as pd
# Safe setting for Pandas.
pd.set_option('mode.copy_on_write', True)

# Set up plotting
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.style.use('fivethirtyeight')
```

As you may remember, the setup for the experiment was the following:

* There were 43 volunteers who took part in the experiment.
* The authors allocated 25 volunteers to the "beer" group, and 18
  to the "water" group.
* Each volunteer had two trails, a "before" trial, and an "after"
  trial.
* The "before" trial was a trial before they drank their
  allocated drink of beer or water.
* The "after" trial was after they drank their allocated drink of
  beer or water.
* In a trial the volunteers sat in tent.  There was a plastic
  tube connecting the tent to a closed box containing 50
  mosquitoes.  The trial started when the experimenters opened
  the box of mosquitoes, allowing them to fly down the tube
  towards the smell of person in the tent.
* The "activated" number is the number, out of 50, of mosquitoes
  that flew out of the box into the plastic tube.

```{python}
mosquitoes = pd.read_csv('mosquito_beer.csv')
mosquitoes.head()
```

```{python}
before_activated = mosquitoes.loc[mosquitoes['test'] == 'before',
                                 ['volunteer', 'group', 'activated']]
before_activated.head()
```

```{python}
after_activated = mosquitoes.loc[mosquitoes['test'] == 'after',
                                 ['volunteer', 'group', 'activated']]
after_activated.head()
```

```{python}
before_activated.merge(after_activated, on='volunteer')
```

```{python}
both = before_activated.merge(after_activated, on='volunteer',
                              suffixes=['_before', '_after'])
both.head()
```

```{python}
both['active_diff'] = both['activated_after'] - both['activated_before']
both.head()
```

```{python}
assert np.all(both['group_before'] == both['group_after'])
```

```{python}
both['group'] = both['group_before']
both = both.drop(columns=['group_before', 'group_after'])
both.head()
```

```{python}
means = both.groupby('group')['active_diff'].mean()
means
```

```{python}
observed_stat = means.loc['beer'] - means.loc['water']
observed_stat
```

```{python}
observed_activated = both['active_diff']
fake_df = both.copy()
```

```{python}
fake_df['active_diff'] = rng.permutation(observed_activated)
fake_means = fake_df.groupby('group')['active_diff'].mean()
fake_stat = fake_means['beer'] - fake_means['water']
fake_stat
```

```{python}
n_iters = 10000
fake_stats = np.zeros(n_iters)
for i in np.arange(n_iters):
    fake_df['activated'] = rng.permutation(observed_activated)
    fake_means = fake_df.groupby('group')['activated'].mean()
    fake_stats[i] = fake_means['beer'] - fake_means['water']
fake_stats[:10]
```

```{python}
plt.hist(fake_stats, bins=50);
plt.plot(observed_stat, 10, 'ro')
plt.title("Sampling distribution of mean difference");
```

```{python}
p = np.count_nonzero(fake_stats >= observed_stat) / n_iters
p
```
